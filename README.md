# Weather Dashboard 

## About the Project
This interactive Weather Application was built using **HTML, Bootstrap framework, and Javascript**. The aim of ths project was to retrieve data from another application's API and using it in the context of my own. The goal is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## Features 
 * A weather dashboard with form inputs
 * A presentation with current and future conditions for the searched city and that city is added to the search history once searched
 * A resentation with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
 * A color that indicates whether the UV conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
 * A 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
